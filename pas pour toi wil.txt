Dear Manager,


	Currently a Game Art student and completing my 5th and final year at Supinfogame Rubika, aVideo Game School in Valenciennes, France, I am highly interested in completing my final year’s 6-month internship at Asobo studio.

	I send you my application with the hope of joining your team over the course of the last semester of 2018, to strengthen my skills. My studies in Game Art allowed me to master a large panel of graphics software that I used for a lot of projects. Though I'm more inclined into doing 3D Environment Art, I try to keep versatility into my works, by doing 2D Art on side projects or FXs. 

As I enjoy to keep versatility in my work, the description of what you expect from a 3D Artist made me realise that Asobo Studio is the kind of studio that I want to join later. Through my studies, the experiences of developing games as school projects hooked me and gave me the will to explore that field and experiment more at a larger scale. 

To work with a passionate team, to be able to swap between the different aspects of graphic production, to juggle with different visual styles and methods, are development aspect that I wish to explore for my future projects.

	My developer experiences working on our Student Game Project, and before that student and personal project of different scopes lead me to know how to integrate well into groups with teams of varioust scales, and to adapt to both the expectations of my Lead Artist and the project’s chosen Art Style. My experiences in Game Jams (Ludum Dare, Global Game Jam) taught me how to work swiftly and efficiently.

	I look forward to hearing from you soon and discussing my motivations even more.
